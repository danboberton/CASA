# SP23-Context-Awareness-BackgroundSound-Alerts

# About

A senior group project, this SPA was designed to administer a scientific experiment to participants and aggregate data in a mongo database. Notification sound effects were played randomly over 3 different background noise contexts, users were asked to click a button when they heard a notification sound. We then calculated a hit rate to investigate how different sound effect and background sound pairings performed. Data analysis done in Juypter Notebook with pandas
